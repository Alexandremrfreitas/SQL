Q9 Shortest distance in a Plane â€” CROSS JOIN, SQRT, POW

9. Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.

-- Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
 

-- | x  | y  |
-- |----|----|
-- | -1 | -1 |
-- | 0  | 0  |
-- | -1 | -2 |
 

-- The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
 

-- | shortest |
-- |----------|
-- | 1.00     |
 

-- Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.


SOLUTION:

SELECT ROUND(a.shortest,2) as shortest
FROM (
        SELECT SQRT(POW((p1.x-p2.x),2)+POW((p1.y-p2.y),2)) as shortest
        FROM point_2d AS p1
        CROSS JOIN point_2d AS p2
        WHERE p1.x!=p2.x OR p1.y!=p2.y
        ORDER BY SQRT(POW((p1.x-p2.x),2)+POW((p1.y-p2.y),2))
        LIMIT 1) AS a
