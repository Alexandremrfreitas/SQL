10. Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

-- Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

-- +----+-----+
-- | Id | Num |
-- +----+-----+
-- | 1  |  1  |
-- | 2  |  1  |
-- | 3  |  1  |
-- | 4  |  2  |
-- | 5  |  1  |
-- | 6  |  2  |
-- | 7  |  2  |
-- +----+-----+
-- For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number 
that appears consecutively for at least three times.

-- +-----------------+


SOLUTION:

SELECT DISTINCT a.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM(
      SELECT num,
      LAG(num) OVER() as prev,
      LEAD(num) OVER() as next
      FROM logs) AS a
WHERE a.num = a.prev AND a.num = a.next
